##### DevFest Berlin supports diversity in technology

We recognize the current status of our industry and we want to want to change it.

Our goal is to enable everybody to learn and teach programming. As such, we
want to enable underrepresented groups in technology to feel welcomed and help
increase the diversity in technology and science.

To this end, we have have a couple of ways to support our mission:

- we will have a number of tickets for which only underrepresented groups can apply
- we will have a mentorship program for new programmers

The mentorship program will pair developers willing to share their passion and
knowledge of technology with new developers or persons interested in becoming a
developer. We believe this will yield a great value both to the mentor and the
mentored person and hope every everyone will have a great opportunity to learn
from it.
