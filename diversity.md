##### DevFest Berlin supports diversity in technology

We recognize the current status of our industry and we want to change it.

Our goal is to enable everybody to learn and teach programming. As such, we
want to enable underrepresented groups in technology to feel welcomed and help
increase the diversity in technology and science.

To this end, we have have a couple of ways to support our mission:

- we will have a number of tickets for which only underrepresented groups can apply
- we will have a mentorship program for new developers

The mentorship program will pair an awardee with a developer mentor to help
familiarize the awardee with the conference. We believe creating a dialogue
between developers at different levels will yield a great value both to the
mentor and the awardee and hope everyone will have a great opportunity to learn
from it.
